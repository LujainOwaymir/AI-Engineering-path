# 🚀 My AI Engineering Path

Welcome! This repository documents my code, notes, and experiments as I learn Generative AI. 
I am following the standard [AI Engineer Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/ai-engineer) to build a solid technical foundation.

## 🗺️ Technical Roadmap

### Phase 1: Fundamentals & Pre-trained Models
> *Focus: Understanding LLMs, APIs, and Prompt Engineering.*
- [ ] **LLM Architecture:** Transformers, GPT models, and Tokens.
- [ ] **Prompt Engineering:** Zero-shot, Few-shot, and Chain-of-Thought.
- [ ] **API Integration:** Connecting to OpenAI/Gemini APIs.

### Phase 2: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
> *Focus: Building systems that "chat with data" using LangChain.*
- [ ] **Embeddings:** Converting text to vectors (OpenAI/HuggingFace).
- [ ] **Vector Databases:** Using Pinecone/ChromaDB.
- [ ] **LangChain Framework:** Building chains and document loaders.
- [ ] **RAG Implementation:** Building a "Chat with PDF" system.

### Phase 3: AI Agents & Advanced Tooling
> *Focus: Autonomous agents and function calling.*
- [ ] **AI Agents:** ReAct prompting and Tools.
- [ ] **Fine-tuning:** Customizing models for specific tasks.
- [ ] **Deployment:** Hosting apps using Streamlit.
